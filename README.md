# Dirichilet-DCA
Minimize the Dirichlet correlation by using a genetic algorithm.

This is the implementation of the algorithm specified in the paper https://icml.cc/Conferences/2008/papers/129.pdf

The precision of the data is estimated using Newton Iteration method. The Balanced Rearrangement matrix which minimizes this precision is selected using a genetic algorithm.
